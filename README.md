# IDMB: Introduction to Data Management

## Overview
The IDMB (Introduction to Data Management) course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data management concepts and tools. Throughout the course, we explored various technologies and techniques essential for managing, analyzing, and processing data effectively.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Python for Data Analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations with multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.

### 2. Databases and Query Languages
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for relational databases.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for working with unstructured and semi-structured data.

### 3. Big Data Tools
- **MapReduce**: Distributed processing framework for handling large datasets.
- **Apache Spark**: Scalable data processing framework for real-time and batch analysis.

## Course Project: Job Board System
As a final project for this course, we developed a **Job Board System**, which is a platform to scrape, store, and analyze job postings. The project focused on integrating various tools and technologies learned during the course, including:
- Web scraping to collect job postings.
- Storing data in SQL and MongoDB databases.
- Analyzing trends using Python (NumPy and Pandas).
- Using Apache Spark for distributed data processing.

### Project Repository
The project was developed and maintained in a separate GitHub repository:
[Job Board Project Repository](https://github.com/Shinhunjun/JobBoardProject)
